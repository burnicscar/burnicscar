# Introduction 

Greetings all, I'm the one and only burnicscar 

I've just started learning how to code with a focus on:

A) M code (power query)

B) Python 3

# Projects

I've studied law and work in tax. My projects will therefore naturally focus on these areas.

Start_Goal - learn to extract data from websites to create useable databases 

End_Goal - automate basic legal/tax services alongside a better repository of information

Empire_Goal - training programme to 'understand' tax and/or law
